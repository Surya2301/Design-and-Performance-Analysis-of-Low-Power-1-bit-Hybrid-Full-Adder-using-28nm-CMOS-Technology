Adders is very important digital element for any arithmetic operation so it plays a vital role in digital and VLSI systems for ALU.
Now a Day, Technology is moving towards on lowering the scale of transistors for enforcing any other digital system. A novel design of a 
Hybrid Full Adder (FA) using Pass Transistors Logic (PTLs), Transmission Gates (TGs) and Conventional Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CCMOS) logic is presented.
The hybrid Full Adder cell with 1-bit is implemented in this structure. The proposed method is investigated using 22-nm CMOS hybrid full adder. 
The proposed architecture demonstrates substantial efficiency in power consumption and delay, based on simulation results. 
The simulation result expressed that the full adder circuit is used to modern high speed ALU. This form of hybrid Full Adder, reduces the delay and increasing efficiency and mainly used in nano technology applications.
The Average power consumption of 1.1055microwatt with moderately low delay of 7.0415ps was found to be extremely low for 0.8V supply at 28nm technology.
# Introduction 
Adder is a Combinational circuit which perform addition of binary bits. A novel 1-bit hybrid full adder using different types of gates like PTs, TGs, and static CMOS logic was 
introduced. In this type of hybrid full adder was designed by 28nm technology. Modern image and video processing operations, digital signal processing (DSP) chips, microprocessors and many other applications require large scale of arithmetic operations. A 1-bit Full Adder (FA) is considered as the nucleus of binary addition since it is the 
fundamental cell for building wide word-length adders.
